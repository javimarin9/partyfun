# PartyFun by JaviMarin

PartyFun is a fun party game, built in React + Vite, where players guess words through three exciting rounds:

1️⃣ Definition: A player describes the word without using it.
2️⃣ One Word: Only a single word can be given as a clue.
3️⃣ Charades: No words—only gestures and expressions!

The team that guesses the most words across all three rounds wins.
